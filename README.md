# explain_ML
How to explain the decision process of a Machine Learning Algorithm.

## Usefull resources:
1. Very fast practical intro to the topic using python (eli, shap, dependence plots) <br>

2. Captum: A library implementing the main ML explainability algorithms for PyTorch models <br>
   https://github.com/pytorch/captum, https://captum.ai/docs/introduction <br>
   
3. Shap: Similar to Captum but for all kind of ML models (trees, model agnostic) and for both PyTorch and Keras NNs. <br>
